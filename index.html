        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1></div>
    <div class="p">
        Hello, visitor! My name is Charlie Sambalod Jr. I am a second-year IT student in University of Science and Technology of Philippines.  I am at the
        age of 20 years old and I live Puerto, Cagayan de Oro. I have been exposed to computers at a very young age and I even learned to do basic video editing
        skills at that age. So it was a no-brainer that I made the decision of pursuing BS-IT in the college I'm attending to.
    </div>

    <div class="p" style="margin-top: 10px;">
        For the past several years, I've been doing Photoshop/Pixlr edits of anything (from school works to birthday cards) here and then. In this portfolio, 
        I will showcase several images I make these edits either for fun or for turning in output to school. You might see chaotic images that are only 
        understandable to few people in the images that I did for fun. For the ones I did to turn in output to school, you might expect a bit more professional with it.

            <div class="justify">Me and my collaborator, Elijah Pajaron, made a Messenger-like application mockup for our HCI final project. This project involves logo and UI designs
                work that were divided between both of us. The application is called Nightcord and it shows several features that are not currently present in the current Messenger app,
                such as Group Chat Folders, Roles, Chat UI Modification and more.</div></td>

            <div class="justify">Another work that I made with Elijah Pajaron for our Grade 12 Entrepreneurship finals. We published a Facebook page for a would-be shop for baked goods
                but there was a pandemic ongoing at that time so we couldn't sell anything. We only made digital flyers and posters for what kind of baked goods we planned to sell. The design
                work were also divided between the two of us.

            <div class="justify">The Istitk website project were made in collaboration with a few of my classmates in 1st Year and also with Elijah Pajaron. We made this website as a final requirement
                for our Art Appreciation course using Google Sites. All of the work including T-shirt designs, content creation and website engineering and design were divided among eight of us. The website engineering
                and design went to me and Elijah.

            <div class="justify">The Daily Picture Diary was a week-long task that was handed to us during Grade 11 for our Empowerment Technologies subject. We were tasked take any pictures during any time of the day
                and make any sort of changes/edits to the picture and repeat the task for seven days. As you can see in the album, there are two sets of pictures: the unedited and edited versions. My best edit is the one
                that is displayed on the website right now.

            <div class="justify">This image contains an edited version of The Scream with hand and "PogChamp" emojis, and a picture of Jose Rizal. I made this edit around 2020
                during Rizal's birthday when Filipino KPop fans knew it was a KPop idol's birthday but didn't know it was also Rizal's birthday at the same day.

            <div class="justify">This weaving pattern art was made on a game called Geometry Dash and we were tasked to do any Mindanao tribal pattern and make an art out of it. I tried a unique way
                of doing it by remaking the pattern in game using pixel blocks.

                album cover, there are also various media you can see in the image that he was into during that year.
