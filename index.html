    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>
        
        Hello, visitor! My name is Charlie Sambalod Jr. I am a second-year IT student in University of Science and Technology of Philippines. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        For the past several years, I've been doing Photoshop/Pixlr edits of anything (from school works to birthday cards) here and then. In this portfolio, 
        I will showcase several images I make these edits either
        for fun or for turning in output to school. You might see chaotic images that are only understandable to few people in the images that I did for fun. For the ones
        I did to turn in output to school, you might expect a bit more professional with it. 
        
    </p>
